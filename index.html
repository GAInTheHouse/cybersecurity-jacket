                    <h4>High security</h4>
                    <li>Store more than one copy: Store your data in several places isolated from each other. For example, you might keep one copy of a file on your computer and another on an external drive or in reliable cloud storage. </li>
                    <li>Secure archive and cryptocontainer passwords: Losing the password for an archive containing important business data means losing that data. Store passwords in a purpose-built application such as our application for creating and securely storing complex passwords. In addition to its password management utility, our security solution for SMBs also features tools for creating cryptocontainers and automating data backup processes.</li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <div class = "yellow-text">
                <ol>
                    <li>Don’t transfer unencrypted data over the Internet: Sometimes you might need to send confidential data online, by e-mail or a file-sharing service. We strongly recommend avoiding it whenever possible, but if you absolutely have to send information, at least encrypt it first, in case of interception. The easiest way is to create a password-protected archive. Almost all archive utilities have this option. After you encrypt the information, send the password to the recipient through a different channel </li>
                    <li>Delete sensitive data you no longer need: Even information that’s fallen out of use can still cause problems, so get rid of it. For less-sensitive information, at the very least, delete it and then empty your Recycle Bin so the data can’t be restored with a simple click. For anything even vaguely sensitive, use a file-shredder utility to prevent recovery.</li>
                    <li>Encrypt backups: Backups are crucial, but they can also be a source of leaks. That’s why, before creating backups of confidential data, you should place them in a cryptocontainer.</li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <div class = "red-text">
                <ol>
                    <li>Enable full disk encryption on all devices: On devices where confidential data is stored or transmitted (i.e., most of them), be sure to enable full disk encryption (FDE). Encryption protects the data in case the device falls into the wrong hands.</li>
                    <li>Restrict confidential data to the office: Another way important data can fall into the wrong hands is through the loss (or theft) of physical media: external hard disks or flash drives. Ideally, they should never leave the office.</li>
