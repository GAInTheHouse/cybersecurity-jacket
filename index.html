            <h3>Wifi Password Testing</h3>
            <div class = "green-text">
                <ol>
                    <h4>High security</h4>
                    <li>Store more than one copy: Store your data in several places isolated from each other. For example, you might keep one copy of a file on your computer and another on an external drive or in reliable cloud storage. </li>
                    <li>Secure archive and cryptocontainer passwords: Losing the password for an archive containing important business data means losing that data. Store passwords in a purpose-built application such as our application for creating and securely storing complex passwords. In addition to its password management utility, our security solution for SMBs also features tools for creating cryptocontainers and automating data backup processes.</li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <div class = "yellow-text">
                <ol>
                    <h4>Medium security</h4>
                    <li>Don’t transfer unencrypted data over the Internet: Sometimes you might need to send confidential data online, by e-mail or a file-sharing service. We strongly recommend avoiding it whenever possible, but if you absolutely have to send information, at least encrypt it first, in case of interception. The easiest way is to create a password-protected archive. Almost all archive utilities have this option. After you encrypt the information, send the password to the recipient through a different channel </li>
                    <li>Delete sensitive data you no longer need: Even information that’s fallen out of use can still cause problems, so get rid of it. For less-sensitive information, at the very least, delete it and then empty your Recycle Bin so the data can’t be restored with a simple click. For anything even vaguely sensitive, use a file-shredder utility to prevent recovery.</li>
                    <li>Encrypt backups: Backups are crucial, but they can also be a source of leaks. That’s why, before creating backups of confidential data, you should place them in a cryptocontainer.</li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <div class = "red-text">
                <ol>
                    <h4>Low security</h4>
                    <li>Enable full disk encryption on all devices: On devices where confidential data is stored or transmitted (i.e., most of them), be sure to enable full disk encryption (FDE). Encryption protects the data in case the device falls into the wrong hands.</li>
                    <li>Restrict confidential data to the office: Another way important data can fall into the wrong hands is through the loss (or theft) of physical media: external hard disks or flash drives. Ideally, they should never leave the office.</li>
              </ol>
            </div>

            <div class = "Virus Testing">
                <h3>Virus Testing</h3>
                <div class = "green-text">
                    <ol>
                        <h4>High security</h4>
                        <li>Protect your private information: While checking email, visiting websites, posting to social media, or shopping, pay attention to where you click and who you give your information to. Unscrupulous websites or data thieves can attempt to trick you into giving them your personal data.</li>
                        <li>Be careful what you click: Phishing attacks—where hackers send seemingly genuine messages to trick you to hand over personal information—are becoming more sophisticated. For instance, you may receive an urgent message stating that your bank account has been locked and requiring you to enter your password and Social Security number to unlock it. Think twice before clicking on links in messages such as this. </li>
                  </ol>
                </div>
                <div class = "yellow-text">
                    <ol>
                        <h4>Medium security</h4>
                        <li>Use stronger authentication: Many social media, email, and financial accounts allow the use of stronger authentication methods. These methods can include using a fingerprint, one-time codes sent to a mobile device, or other features that ensure a user is supposed to have access to the account.</li>
                        <li>Choose strong passwords: Protect your devices and accounts from intruders by choosing passwords that are hard to guess. Use strong passwords with at least eight characters, a combination of letters, numbers and special characters. Don't use a word that can easily be found in a dictionary or any reference to personal information, such as a birthday. </li>
                  </ol>
                </div>
                <div class = "red-text">
                    <ol>
                        <h4>Low security</h4>
                        <li>Antivirus software: Antivirus software protects your device from viruses that can destroy your data, slow down or crash your device, or allow spammers to send email through your account. Antivirus protection scans your files and your incoming email for viruses, and then deletes anything malicious. You must keep your antivirus software updated to cope with the latest "bugs" circulating the internet.</li>
                        <li>Antispyware software: Spyware is software installed without your knowledge or consent that can monitor your online activities and collect personal information while you're online. Some kinds of spyware, called keyloggers, record everything you key in—including your passwords and financial information. Signs that your device may be infected with spyware include a sudden flurry of ads, being taken to websites you don't want to go to, and generally slowed performance.</li>
                        <li>Keep up-to-date: Update your system, browser, and important apps regularly, taking advantage of automatic updating when it's available. These updates can eliminate software flaws that allow hackers to view your activity or steal information. </li>
                  </ol>
                </div>
                
            </div>
                
            <div class = "Access Control Testing">
                <h3>Access Control Testing</h3>
                <div class = "green-text">
                    <ol>
                        <h4>High security</h4>
                        <li>Disable rebooting the computer remotely: By default, some operating systems allow for remote rebooting via services or applications running on other computers</li>
                  </ol>
                </div>
                <div class = "yellow-text">
                    <ol>
                        <h4>Medium security</h4>
                        <li>Disable account logon scripts: Some operating systems, such as Windows Vista / Server 2008, allow user accounts to automatically execute certain system scripts when they are logged in. While this can be beneficial in terms of security and adding an extra layer of protection, it can also become a problem if users decide to bypass the normal user logon process and directly run any unknown system scripts on the compromised system. If you do enable user account logon scripts, ensure that they are non-authoritative (i.e., they do not run with administrator rights).</li>
                        <li>Limit local privileges: One of the most common ways of exploiting a vulnerability is by creating a local account with unlimited privileges and then using this account to log in at an elevated, privileged level. To prevent this, you should use standard user accounts when performing administrative tasks and limit any elevated privilege accounts to their specific function.</li>
                  </ol>
                </div>
                <div class = "red-text">
                    <ol>
                        <h4>Low security</h4>
                        <li>Remove administrator rights for users with non-administrative roles: Even if a user does not have administrative rights, it is possible to escalate privileges by using vulnerabilities that allow “low privilege” users to elevate their privileges without any form of authorization from administrators. By removing admin rights from all but administrators, you are ensuring that even if a vulnerability exists which allows unauthorized access, it will not be used maliciously by those who do not have the means to wield it.</li>
                        <li>Disable SMB protocol support: Some operating systems, such as Microsoft Server 2008 / 2012 and Windows 7 / 10, allow attackers to exploit vulnerabilities via the remote file sharing protocol (also known as SMB). Windows Server 2000, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Vista do not support SMB but allow for alternative versions called SMB v1 and v2.</li>
                  </ol>
