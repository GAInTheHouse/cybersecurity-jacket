        <h4>High security</h4>
        <li>Disable rebooting the computer remotely: By default, some operating systems allow for remote rebooting via services or applications running on other computers</li>
  </ol>
<div class = "red-text">
    <ol>
        <h4>Low security</h4>
        <li>Remove administrator rights for users with non-administrative roles: Even if a user does not have administrative rights, it is possible to escalate privileges by using vulnerabilities that allow “low privilege” users to elevate their privileges without any form of authorization from administrators. By removing admin rights from all but administrators, you are ensuring that even if a vulnerability exists which allows unauthorized access, it will not be used maliciously by those who do not have the means to wield it.</li>
        <li>Disable SMB protocol support: Some operating systems, such as Microsoft Server 2008 / 2012 and Windows 7 / 10, allow attackers to exploit vulnerabilities via the remote file sharing protocol (also known as SMB). Windows Server 2000, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Vista do not support SMB but allow for alternative versions called SMB v1 and v2.</li>
