        <h4>Medium security</h4>
        <li>Don’t transfer unencrypted data over the Internet: Sometimes you might need to send confidential data online, by e-mail or a file-sharing service. We strongly recommend avoiding it whenever possible, but if you absolutely have to send information, at least encrypt it first, in case of interception. The easiest way is to create a password-protected archive. Almost all archive utilities have this option. After you encrypt the information, send the password to the recipient through a different channel </li>
        <li>Delete sensitive data you no longer need: Even information that’s fallen out of use can still cause problems, so get rid of it. For less-sensitive information, at the very least, delete it and then empty your Recycle Bin so the data can’t be restored with a simple click. For anything even vaguely sensitive, use a file-shredder utility to prevent recovery.</li>
        <li>Encrypt backups: Backups are crucial, but they can also be a source of leaks. That’s why, before creating backups of confidential data, you should place them in a cryptocontainer.</li>
