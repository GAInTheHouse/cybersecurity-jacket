        <h4>Low security</h4>
        <li>Antivirus software: Antivirus software protects your device from viruses that can destroy your data, slow down or crash your device, or allow spammers to send email through your account. Antivirus protection scans your files and your incoming email for viruses, and then deletes anything malicious. You must keep your antivirus software updated to cope with the latest "bugs" circulating the internet.</li>
        <li>Antispyware software: Spyware is software installed without your knowledge or consent that can monitor your online activities and collect personal information while you're online. Some kinds of spyware, called keyloggers, record everything you key inâ€”including your passwords and financial information. Signs that your device may be infected with spyware include a sudden flurry of ads, being taken to websites you don't want to go to, and generally slowed performance.</li>
        <li>Keep up-to-date: Update your system, browser, and important apps regularly, taking advantage of automatic updating when it's available. These updates can eliminate software flaws that allow hackers to view your activity or steal information. </li>
