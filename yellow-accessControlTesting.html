        <h4>Medium security</h4>
        <li>Disable account logon scripts: Some operating systems, such as Windows Vista / Server 2008, allow user accounts to automatically execute certain system scripts when they are logged in. While this can be beneficial in terms of security and adding an extra layer of protection, it can also become a problem if users decide to bypass the normal user logon process and directly run any unknown system scripts on the compromised system. If you do enable user account logon scripts, ensure that they are non-authoritative (i.e., they do not run with administrator rights).</li>
        <li>Limit local privileges: One of the most common ways of exploiting a vulnerability is by creating a local account with unlimited privileges and then using this account to log in at an elevated, privileged level. To prevent this, you should use standard user accounts when performing administrative tasks and limit any elevated privilege accounts to their specific function.</li>
