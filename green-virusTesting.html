        <h4>High security</h4>
        <li>Protect your private information: While checking email, visiting websites, posting to social media, or shopping, pay attention to where you click and who you give your information to. Unscrupulous websites or data thieves can attempt to trick you into giving them your personal data.</li>
        <li>Be careful what you click: Phishing attacks—where hackers send seemingly genuine messages to trick you to hand over personal information—are becoming more sophisticated. For instance, you may receive an urgent message stating that your bank account has been locked and requiring you to enter your password and Social Security number to unlock it. Think twice before clicking on links in messages such as this. </li>
    </ol>

                        <h4>Medium security</h4>
                        <li>Use stronger authentication: Many social media, email, and financial accounts allow the use of stronger authentication methods. These methods can include using a fingerprint, one-time codes sent to a mobile device, or other features that ensure a user is supposed to have access to the account.</li>
                        <li>Choose strong passwords: Protect your devices and accounts from intruders by choosing passwords that are hard to guess. Use strong passwords with at least eight characters, a combination of letters, numbers and special characters. Don't use a word that can easily be found in a dictionary or any reference to personal information, such as a birthday. </li>
                  </ol>

                        <h4>Low security</h4>
                        <li>Antivirus software: Antivirus software protects your device from viruses that can destroy your data, slow down or crash your device, or allow spammers to send email through your account. Antivirus protection scans your files and your incoming email for viruses, and then deletes anything malicious. You must keep your antivirus software updated to cope with the latest "bugs" circulating the internet.</li>
                        <li>Antispyware software: Spyware is software installed without your knowledge or consent that can monitor your online activities and collect personal information while you're online. Some kinds of spyware, called keyloggers, record everything you key in—including your passwords and financial information. Signs that your device may be infected with spyware include a sudden flurry of ads, being taken to websites you don't want to go to, and generally slowed performance.</li>
                        <li>Keep up-to-date: Update your system, browser, and important apps regularly, taking advantage of automatic updating when it's available. These updates can eliminate software flaws that allow hackers to view your activity or steal information. </li>

                        <h4>High security</h4>
                        <li>Disable rebooting the computer remotely: By default, some operating systems allow for remote rebooting via services or applications running on other computers</li>

                        <h4>Medium security</h4>
                        <li>Disable account logon scripts: Some operating systems, such as Windows Vista / Server 2008, allow user accounts to automatically execute certain system scripts when they are logged in. While this can be beneficial in terms of security and adding an extra layer of protection, it can also become a problem if users decide to bypass the normal user logon process and directly run any unknown system scripts on the compromised system. If you do enable user account logon scripts, ensure that they are non-authoritative (i.e., they do not run with administrator rights).</li>
                        <li>Limit local privileges: One of the most common ways of exploiting a vulnerability is by creating a local account with unlimited privileges and then using this account to log in at an elevated, privileged level. To prevent this, you should use standard user accounts when performing administrative tasks and limit any elevated privilege accounts to their specific function.</li>
                  </ol>
                </div>

                        <h4>Low security</h4>
                        <li>Remove administrator rights for users with non-administrative roles: Even if a user does not have administrative rights, it is possible to escalate privileges by using vulnerabilities that allow “low privilege” users to elevate their privileges without any form of authorization from administrators. By removing admin rights from all but administrators, you are ensuring that even if a vulnerability exists which allows unauthorized access, it will not be used maliciously by those who do not have the means to wield it.</li>
                        <li>Disable SMB protocol support: Some operating systems, such as Microsoft Server 2008 / 2012 and Windows 7 / 10, allow attackers to exploit vulnerabilities via the remote file sharing protocol (also known as SMB). Windows Server 2000, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Vista do not support SMB but allow for alternative versions called SMB v1 and v2.</li>
