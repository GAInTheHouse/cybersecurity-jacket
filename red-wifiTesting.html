        <h4>Low security</h4>
        <li>Enable full disk encryption on all devices: On devices where confidential data is stored or transmitted (i.e., most of them), be sure to enable full disk encryption (FDE). Encryption protects the data in case the device falls into the wrong hands.</li>
        <li>Restrict confidential data to the office: Another way important data can fall into the wrong hands is through the loss (or theft) of physical media: external hard disks or flash drives. Ideally, they should never leave the office.</li>
